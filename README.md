## Analysis of Risk prediction in life insurance industry using supervised learning algorithms
Nimalan Subramanian

This project aims to replicate one of the methods used in the above study to determine the validity of such methods. This is done by using the Prudential Life Insurance Data Set that the authors have 
used. The main target of the project is to determine if the PCA and CFS selection process is reproducible. Given that they are reproducible, the backbone for further supervised learning methods are
possible. Additionally, the project looks at the moral/ethical implications of utilzing such an algorithm in the real world.
