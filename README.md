Nimalan Subramanian

This project aims to replicate one of the methods used in the above study to determine the validity of such methods. This is done by using the Prudential Life Insurance Data Set that the authors have 
used. The main method that the project aims to test is the ANN method. Additionally, the project looks at the moral/ethical implications of utilzing such an algorithm in the real world.
